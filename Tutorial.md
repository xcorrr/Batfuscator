# Mini Tutorial: Batfuscator - Batch File Obfuscator

# What is **Batfuscator**?
**Batfuscator** is a tool that obfuscates both **.bat** and **.cmd** files, making them harder to read or modify.

# How to Use:

# 1. Download & Locate.
After downloading **Batfuscator**, find its location (e.g., Downloads folder).  

# 2. Change Directory.
**Open Command Prompt (cmd) and navigate to the folder where Batfuscator is saved.**
(If downloaded elsewhere, adjust the path accordingly.)  

# 3. Run the Obfuscator.
To obfuscate a **.bat** or **.cmd** file, run:  
**Batfuscator.bat <file.bat>**  
or  
**Batfuscator.bat <file.cmd>**
(Replace <file.bat> or <file.cmd> with the actual filename.)  

# 4. Check the Output  
After execution, the obfuscated version of your file will be generated.  

# ðŸŽ¯ Use Case  
This is useful for protecting batch scripts from easy modification or reverse engineering.
